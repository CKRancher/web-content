# Workspace for evangelism content

Develop web content here until we know what our CMS will eventually be. Write in Mardown since that format is easy to convert to anything. For now, don't focus on looks & layout - focus on content. 

# What you need

git client
text editor (vi, nano, emacs, notepad, etc.) or IDE (VSCode, Atom, Sublime)
hugo if you want to render web content locally
Images should be created with draw.io preferably

# Ground rules

One markdown file per blog post in content subdirectory
Images go to...
No commits to main branch - use topic branches (also makes it easier to work on multiple blogs in parallel)

# Basic Workflow

Clone repo
Create topic branch
Edit your files
Commit to topic branch
Create a pull request when ready to merge to main

# Rendering content locally
